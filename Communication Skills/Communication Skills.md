## How to talk when you don't want to?
* **Parrotting technique**
    * Follow up on what others are saying - pick stuff from what they said, and ask back.
    * As a side effect/bonus the other person will feel respected and being aware of the fact that you are interested in him, likely it is that he too is, in you (Networking)
    * Ofcourse, not for long :P .

## A more effective way to thank
* Add a reason.
* Plain "thanks!" looks like a _mere_ formality (doesn't add to to the emotion, based on context)
