# Tips to focus

## * Prioritize goals
* Put items into a matrix, to see a clearer picture and plan
    * Axes
      * Importance {less, more}
      * Urgency {less, more}


## * Declutter your space
* Mental and physical (start with the latter)

## * Write more
* Write down, what you
  * learn
  * think
  * observe
* They may need not be complete.
* Its not necessary to go back.
* Purpose is to write now, for now.

## * Move from "It should be.." to "It is.."
* See what you can do with what you have in hand, keeping end goal in mind

## * Free yourself from people in your surroundings that induce negativity, distract etc.

## * Repeat -> Habit is formed
* Its easier to things you have a habit of doing.
* Repitition is the only way to get habituated.
* A small change/step leads to exponential change (postively improvement) in end result - to accomplishing and executing.

## * Time your activities well
* Dawn and Dusk are good times to focus and concentrate to work on things that require mental contemplation.

## * Save yourself from "Respect" and "Disrespect"
* Free yourself.
* Don't expect respect or disrespect.
* This will help you detach and focus on what you want to do and will always keep you aligned with what right for you.

## * Complete atleast 1 atomic phase of 1 task, in one go at a time
* Don't multi-task. Its over-rated, and doesn't scale.
