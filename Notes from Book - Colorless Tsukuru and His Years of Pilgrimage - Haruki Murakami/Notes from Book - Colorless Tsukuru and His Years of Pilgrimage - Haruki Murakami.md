# Notes from Book - Colorless Tsukuru and His Years of Pilgrimage - Haruki Murakami

## Introduction
Tsukuru Tazaki had four best friends at school. By chance all of their names contained a color, Black, White, Red, Blue and Gray - Tsukuru. One day, Tsukuru’s friends announced that they did not want to see him, talk to him ever again. That was an abrupt and forceful ending of bond that Tsukuru shared with the group.

Since that day, Tsukuru has been floating through life, unable to form intimate connections with anyone. But then he meets Sara, who tells him that the time has come to find out what happened all those years ago.



## Chapter 1
He loved to watch as the trains passed by the station, or slowed down as they pulled up to the platform.


[after disconnection]
Tsukuru was happy, and proud, to be included as one indispensable side of the pentagon. He loved his four friends, loved the sense of belonging he felt when he was with them. Like a young tree absorbing the nutrition from the soil it is rooted in. Tsukuru got the sustenance he needed as an adolescent from this group, using it as a necessary food to grow, storing what was left as an emergency heat source inside him. Still, he had a constant, nagging fear that someday he would fall away from this intimate community, or be forced out and left on his own. Anxiety raised it's head, like a jagged, ominous rock exposed by the receding tide, the fear that he would be separated from the group and end up entirely alone. 



## Chapter 2
He was left feeling like he’d swallowed a lump of something he shouldn't have, something he couldn't spit out, or digest in.

Tsukuru had trouble sleeping. He felt agitated. Random, senseless thoughts flitted around in his head. But all these thoughts were just variations on one thee. Like a man who has lost his sense of direction. 

Tsukuru took a breath, and silently repeated Ao’s words, quickly assessing them. He tried to read the emotions behind them, but the words were like the formal recitations of an announcement. There had been no room for feelings.


I don't know how to put it, but at the time, nothing seemed to matter. The door was slammed in my face, and they wouldn’t let me back inside.


Searching  for the reason, or correcting a misunderstanding, was beyond me. I was simply, and utterly, in shock. So much so that I thought I might never recover. It felt like something inside me had snapped. 


[Me]
Sometimes, the most unnatural/unexpected happens, and it is beyond our scope to reason it out. Such times do occur. Time is the biggest healer.

I was afraid of pursuing it, of whatever facts might come to light. Of actually coming face-to-face with them.


When I did return, I tried not to leave my house, and once I was done with whatever I had to do, I came back to Tokyo as quickly as I could. My mother and older sisters were worried and asked me if something had happened, but I never said anything. There was no way I could tell them.


In a lot of ways I have become a different person. Well, I feel more often how dull and insignificant I am for other people. And for myself.


[Sara]
I still don't follow, Sara said. The pain caused by that incident is still in your mind, or your heart. Or maybe both. But I think it’s very clearly there. Yet for the last fifteen or sixteen years, you’ve never tried to trace the reason why you had to suffer that.
[Tsukuru]
I’m not saying I didn’t feel like knowing the truth. But after all these years, I think it’s better just to forget about it. It was a long time ago, and it's all sunk within the past.

You can hide memories, suppress them, but you can’t erase the history that produced them. Sara, directly said looking into his eyes, If nothing else, you need to remember that. You can’t erase history, or change it. It would be like destroying yourself.

Sara smiled, Maybe you needed to talk with somebody. More than you ever imagined. 

[Me]
I prefer writing over speaking. The least I have is the confidence of having expressed close to everything and that it could be backtracked to understand fully.


Colors he’d once seen appeared completely different.

For the five months after he returned to Tokyo, Tsukuru lived at death’s door. He set up a tiny place to dwell, all by himself, on the time of a dark abyss. A perilous spot, teetering on the edge, where if he rolled over in his sleep, he might plunge into the depths of the void. Yet he wasn’t afraid. All he thought about was how easy it would be to fall in.

Tsukuru couldn’t fathom what this substance was. He couldn’t accept it or reject it. 

He was himself then, but at the same time, he was not. 

When he couldn’t stand the pain, he distanced himself from his body, and from a nearby, painless spot, observed Tsukuru Tazaki enduring the agony. If he concentrated really hard, it wasn’t impossible. 

There are certain thoughts that, no matter what, you have to keep inside. And it was those kinds of thoughts that ran through Tsukuru’s head as he rode the train home.

[Me]
Love is not generated. It happens, then you pursue it, engender it, maintain it. It can never be created at will, it happens. Love is an affinity or a force that can act to attract or repel, which forms the two (but one) truest and eternal and integral constituent of Universe, Universe with mind and matter and Universe without mind and matter.


## Chapter 3

Tsukuru had never understood the feeling of jealousy. He understood the concept, of course - the sensation you could have toward a person who possesses - or could easily acquire - the talents or gifts or position you covet. The feeling of being deeply in love with a woman only to find her in the arms of another man. Envy - resentment - regret - a frustration and anger for which there is no outlet.


But those dissatisfactions and deficiencies stayed inside him - they weren’t the type of emotions what motivated him to go out, somewhere else, in search of answers. At least until then.

Jealousy - at least as far as he understood from his dream - was the most hopeless prison in the world. Jealousy was not a place he was forced into by someone else, but a jail in which the inmate entered voluntarily, locked the door, and threw away the key. And not another soul in the world knew he was locked inside. Of Course if he wanted to escape, he could do so. The prison, was after all his own heart. But he couldn’t make the decision. His heart was as hard as a stone wall. This was the very essence of jealousy.


He speculated that, just as a powerful west wind blows away thick banks of clouds, the graphic, scorching emotion that passed through his soul in the form of a dream must have cancelled and negated the longing for death, a longing that had reached out and grabbed him around the neck. All that remained was a sort of quiet resignation. A colorless, neutral empty feeling.

In any case, the boy Tsukuru Tazaki had died. In the savage darkness he’d breathed his last and was buried in a small clearing in the forest. Quietly, secretly, in the predawn while everyone was still fast asleep. There was no grave marker. And what stood here now, breathing, was a brand-new Tsukuru Tazaki, one whose substance had been totally replaced. But he was the only one who knew it. And he didn’t plan to tell.

He did his best to keep busy.

Habit, in fact was what propelled his life forward. Though he no longer believed in a perfect community, nor felt the warmth of chemistry between people.



## Chapter 4 - New Friend - Haida

[Me] 
Having a passion and having interest may not always be the same thing.


Ideas are like beards. Men don't have it until they grow up.

Pain is what gives rise to meditation. It has nothing to do with age, let alone beards.


He wondered how he should greet then if they did. But none of them showed up. Tsukuru felt relieved, but at the same time a little sad, and it hit him all over again: what they had had really was over.

Everything has boundaries. The same holds true with thoughts. You shouldn’t fear boundaries, but you also should not be afraid of destroying them. That’s what is most important if you want to be free: respect for and exasperation with boundaries.

The pain of having been so openly rejected was always with him. But now, like the tide, it ebbed and flowed. At times it flowed up to his feet, at other time it withdrew far away, so far away that he could barely detect it.

[In the brain, in the heart]
Why can’t they make a quiet exit and leave me alone?




## Chapter 5 - Story which Haida’s father often narrated to him

There is no logic or illogic in that scene. No good or evil. Everything is merged into one. And you are one part of that merging. 

No matter how shallow and dull things might get, this life is worth living.

You need to use the thread of logic, as best as you can, to skillfully sew onto yourself everything that’s worth living for.





## Chapter 6 - Sara wanted to know about Tsukuru’s lost four friends. But Why?

Sara said, But even if it ended badly, and you were hurt, I think it was a good thing for you to have met them. It's not very often that people become that close. And when you think of five people having that sort of connection, well, it's nothing short of miraculous.

The feeling of loss, the isolation..Those words don't even come close to expressing how awful it felt.

[Tsukuru]
Like I told you, I want to put it all out of my mind. I’ve managed to slowly close up the wound and, somehow, conquer the pain. It took a long time. Now that the wound is closed, why gouge it open again?
[Sara]
I understand, but maybe it only appears, from the outside, that the wound is closed. Maybe inside the wound, under the scab, the blood is still silently flowing.

[Sara]
If we’re going to have a serious relationship, I don’t want whatever it is to come between us. This unidentifiable “something”.


[Tsukuru]
But I think they are the kind of problems you can overcome, if you really make up your mind to do so. Just like you’d set about repairing a defect in a station.
[Sara]
You need to come face-to-face with the past, not as some naive, easily wounded boy, but as a grown up, independent professional. Not to see what you want to see, but what you must see. (Otherwise you’ll carry around the baggage for the rest of your life)


[Tsukuru]
I’m the sort of person who craves stability. 
[Me] Is this a sign of insecurity/dissatisfaction?

[Tsukuru]
i might have been afraid that if I really loved someone and needed her, one day she might suddenly disappear without a word, and I’d be left all alone.


As he gazed at the four names on the screen, and considered the memories those names brought back, he felt the past silently mingling with the present, as a time that should have been long gone hovered in the air around him. Like odorless, colorless smoke leaking into the room through a small crack in the door. Finally, at a certain point, he snapped back to the present.


He waited for time to become real again.

[Sara]
Personally, I’m curious about them. I want to find out more about these people who are still weighing you down.

[Tsukuru]
Those four people are still stuck with me. Probably more tightly than Sara can ever imagine.

[Me]
I think Sara did the right thing. Tsukuru would not have been able to move on, unless this misery of past could be resolved or necessary it was, this miserable past should not have been weighing him down. The condition that Sara put was merely a key to open through (for Tsukuru) otherwise he would have left it the way it is and would have carried the load always. He would never be able to become a complete adult with such regrets and guilts. Either he resolved them or forget and leave it forever, but not this one could have been, since the blood still flew under those old but painful scars.




## Chapter 7
In the darkness, Tsukuru searched for words. Not words directed at any particular reason. He just felt he had to say something, had to find even one word to fill that mute, anonymous gap.

Tsukuru decided not to pursue it further. He could think about it all he wanted and never find an answer. He placed this doubt inside a drawer in his mind labelled “Pending” and postponed any further consideration. He had many such drawers inside him, with numerous doubts and questions tucked away.

Without a word, giving no reason, he may have gone just somewhere. Like his four friends had done back in his hometown.
[Me] Fear of loss: Tsukuru had still not overcome the bereavement. Just a week, and he though Haida too left him “abruptly” forever, and that he would “never turn back to him”.


Maybe I am fated to always be alone, Tsukuru found himself thinking. People came to him, but in the end they always left. They came seeking something, but either they couldn’t find it or were unhappy with what they found (or else they were disappointed or angry), and then they left. One day, without warning, they vanished, with no explanation, no word of farewell. Like a silent hatchet had sliced the ties between them, ties through which warm blood still flowed, along with a quiet pulse.

[Tsukuru]
I basically have nothing to offer to others. If you think about it. I don't even have anything to offer to myself.

Yes his young friend’s casual return made Tsukuru feel as i he were somehow able to spit out a hard lump of air that had been stuck in his chest. Tsukuru still needed his younger friend, Haida. More than anything.



## Chapter 8

Was that whole story about his father a fabrication? Had he been trying to relate something about himself, making it sound as if it had happened to his father?




## Chapter 9




## Chapter 10

Tsukuru had decided that - no matter which of his friends he saw - he would casually show up without an appointment. He wanted to get an honest response when they saw him again, without giving them a chance to mentally prepare themselves for his visit. If he wasn’t able to meet with them when he showed up, or if they refused to see him, he’d just have to live with it. If it came to that, he’d figure out another approach.

Tsukuru was glad he had decided to wear a suit and nice leather shoes. He had no idea what people coming to buys a Lexus normally wore, but they might not have taken him seriously if he’d been decked out in a polo t-shirt, jeans and sneakers.

Sixteen years have gone by, but it feels like the wound is still there inside me. Like it’s still bleeding. Something happened recently, something very significant to me, that made me realize this. That’s why I came to Nagoya to see you. I apologize for showing up out of the blues like this.

Words don't come out when you’re hurt that deeply.

[Random thought (Me)]
Life is not a sprint but a marathon. You always keep going, but you go slow. You don't move fast, but just keep going, at times, running, at times walking, at times jogging, even when you are catching up your breath, you move, because you moved slow, you are able to move.


## Chapter 11

[Meeting with Aka]

[Strange but true]
The majority of people in the world have no problem following orders. They’re actually happy to be told what to do. They might complain, but that’s not how they feel. They just grumble out of habit. If you told them to think for themselves, and make their own decisions and take responsibility for them, they’d be clueless.


[CEO of the company]
We want to create a workforce that does what their company wants them to do, yet still believes they’re independent thinkers.


The truth sometimes reminds me of a city buried in sand. As time passes, the sand piles up even thicker, and occasionally it's blown away and what's below is revealed.

You can hide memories, but you can’t erase them.

[about Shiro]
The kind of beautiful music she played blew us away, but unfortunately she demanded more from herself.




## Chapter 12

Keep going a little further, and I’s sure you’ll discover the right pieces that fill in the gaps.




## Chapter 13

[Sara felt that Tsukuru still was carrying the load of the abrupt rejection by his group, which happened 16 years ago. Sara’s wisdom said, that he should first sort those things out, and get the answers for the questions unanswered, and then would he actually be ready for good long term relationship.]
Take your time, I can wait. Sara had said. But things weren’t that simple. People are in constant motion, never stationary. No one knows what will happen next.

The pain he’d felt in his heart didn't stem from jealousy.

[Pain too can be comforting]
All he felt was sorrow, as if he’d been abandoned at the bottom of a deep, dark pit. That’s all it was - sorrow. That, and simple physical pain. He actually found this comforting.

What really shocked him, though, was how happy she looked. When she talked with that man, he whole face lit up. She had never showed such an unguarded expression when she was with Tsukuru, not once. With him, she always maintained a cool, controlled look. More than anything else, that's what tore, unbearably, at his heart.

The ache in his heart returned. Not an intense pain, but the memory of the intense pain. What did you expect? Tsukuru asked himself. A basically empty vessel has become empty once again. People come to him, discover how empty he is, and leave. What’s left is empty, perhaps even emptier. Tsukuru Tazaki all alone.

[Me]
All one can be grateful in the dead of the night is the ability to fall asleep. Sleep prevents you best off of despair, pain and the feeling of someone tearing your heart slowly and deliberately. One should be grateful to able to sleep, to be able to close his eyes, close his mental eyes too, if at all he can. 



## Chapter 14

Vacations and friends are the two best things in life. ([Me] Rest have responsibilities)

Some things in life are too complicated to explain in any language. Not just to explain to others, but to explain to yourself. Force yourself to try to explain it, and you create lies.

The human heart is like a night bird. Silently waiting for something and when the time comes, it flies straight towards it.

Sleep finally took hold of him.




## Chapter 15


## Chapter 16
[Kuro]

I still have that fear, even now - that suddenly my very existence will be denied and, through no fault of my own, I’ll be hurled into the night sea once more. Maybe that's why I haven't been able to form deep relationships with people. I always keep a distance between me and others.

Focussing on creating something helped me to forget everything else.


One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony.




[When they met]
Words are powerless now. Like a pair of dancers who had stopped mid-step, they simply held each other quietly, giving themselves up to the flow of time. Time that encompassed both past and present, and even a portion of the future. Nothing came between their two bodies, as her warm breath brushed his neck. Tsukuru shut his eyes, letting the music wash over him as he listened to Eri’s heartbeat. The beating of her heart kept time with the slap of a little boat against the pier.


## Chapter 17 - Meeting with Eri
Things they had not put into words for ages, things they’d been holding back deep in their souls. Removing the lids on their hearts, pulling open the doors of memory, revealing honest feelings, as the other, all the while, listened quietly.

Truthfully, I didn’t abandon you just because of Yuzu. That’s a superficial justification. I did it because I’m a coward. I didn't have any confidence in myself as a woman. I was sure that no matter how much I loved you, you would never reciprocate. I was sure you were in love with Yuzu. That’s why I was able to cut you off so cruelly. I did it to sever my feelings for you. If I had only had a little more confidence and courage, and no stupid pride, I never would have abandoned you like that, no matter what the circumstances. But something was wrong with me back then. I knew I did something terrible. And I am truly sorry for it.

[Eri (in Finland)]
Tsukuru, there’s one thing I want you to remember. You aren’t colorless. Those were just the names. I know we often teased you about it, but it was a stupid joke. Tsukuru Tazaki is a wonderful, colorless person. A person who builds fantastic stations. A healthy 36 yr old citizen. You don't lack anything. Be confident and be bold. That's all you need. Never let fear and stupid pride make you lose someone who’s precious to you.


## Chapter 18

You’re not a simple person. You just try to think you are.

In the darkness, he thought about Sara. He agonized over every word he’d spoken to her earlier on the phone. He should never have said what he did. He wanted to call her and take back everything and he’d said.
[[Me] It is natural. Such thoughts don't cross your mind, until you have spoken. But then these are straight invitations to misunderstandings.]


## Chapter 19
