## Talent

* More of pre-requisite than a necessary quality
  * No matter how much enthu and effort you put into writing, if you totally lack literary talent you can forget about being a novelist.
* The novelist as runner, should train for a career running marathons.



## Focus

* Murakami defines, focus as 
> The ability to concentrate all your limitaed talents on whatever;s critial at the moment. Without that you can't accomplish anything of value.
* Just sit and do it.



## Endurance

* “If you concentrate on writing three or four hours a day and feel tired after a week of this,” Murakami chides, “you’re not going to be able to write a long work. What’s needed of the writer of fiction—at least one who hopes to write a novel—is the energy to focus every day for half a year, or a year, or two years. Fortunately, these two disciplines—focus and endurance—are different from talent, since they can be acquired and sharpened through training.”
* It involves the same process as jogging every day to strengthen your muscles and develop a runner's physique.
