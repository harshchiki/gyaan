# Introduction
* Every obstacle is unique to each of us. But the responses they elicit are the same:
    * Fear
    * Frustration
    * Confusion
    * Helplessness
    * Depression
    * Anger
    
* What this book is about? (or atleast what it claims to be)
    * Learn to be ceaselessly creative and opportunistic
        * Not: This is not so bad.
        * But: I can make this good.
        
* Overcoming obstacles is a discipling of 3 critical steps (3 interdependant, interconnected and fluidly contingent disciplines, Simple but not easy)
    1. Perception: Attitude and approach
    2. Action: Energy and creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities
    3. Will: Cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty.
    
    
# Perception
* Our perceptions can be a source of stength or of great wekness.
* If we are emotional, subjective and short-sighted, we only add to our troubles.
* To prevent becoming overwhelmed by the world around us, we must, as the ancients practiced, lean how to limit our passions and their control over our lives.
* Bat away the pests of bad perceptions, to separate reliable signals from deceptive ones, to filter out prejudice, expectation and fear.
* But its worth it, for whats left is truth. While others are excited or afraid, we will remain calm and imperturable. We will see things simple and striaghtforwardly, as they truly are - neither good nor bad. This will be an incredible advantage for us in the fight against obstacles.
