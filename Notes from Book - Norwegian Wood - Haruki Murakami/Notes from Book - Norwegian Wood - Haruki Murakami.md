# Norwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami



## Chapter 1


Eighteen years have gone by, and still I can bring back every detail of that day in the meadow.


Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene I Hardly paid it any attention. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make a lasting impression, certainly never imagines that 18 years later I would recall it in such detail.


It takes time, though, for Naoko’s face to appear. And as the years have passed , the time has grown longer.

Shadows lengthening at dusk. Someday, I suppose, the shadows will be swallowed up in darkness.

I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.

“Don't worry, I won’t.”
Naoko took her left hand from her pocket and squeezed my hand. “Don’t you worry”, she said. “You’ll be OK. You could go running all around here in the middle of the night and you’d never fall into the well. And as long as I stick with you, I won’t fall in, either.”

“I know these things. I’m always right. It’s got nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I’m really close to you like this, I’m not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil could ever tempt me.”

“I’m not all that smart. It takes me a while to understand things. But is I do have the time, I will come to understand you - better than anyone else in the world.”

Even so, my memory has grown increasingly dim, and I have already forgotten any number of things. Writing from memory like this, I often feel a pang of dread. What is I’ve forgotten the most important thing? What is somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?
Be it as it may, it's all I have to work with. Clutching these faded, fading, imperfect memories to my breast, I go on writing this book with all the desperate intensity of a starving man sucking on bones. This is the only way I know to keep my promise to Naoko.

I knew that is that first line would come, the rest would pour itself onto the page. 

The more the memories of Naoko inside me fade, the more deeply I am able to understand her.


## Chapter 2

Once she had finished saying whatever she wanted to say, she’d face front again and keep on walking.
This was no mere stroll for Naoko.

I was just an ordinary kid who liked to read books and listen to music and didn’t stand out in any way that would prompt someone like Kizuki to pay attention to  me. 

We never knew what to talk about.

I was more of a listener than a talker, so I felt uncomfortable when I was left alone with her. Not that we were incompatible: we just had nothing to talk about.

Stop taking everything so seriously; establish a proper distance between myself and everything else.

Death exists, not as the opposite but as part of life.

With that know of air in my chest, but I struggled all the while against becoming serious. Becoming serious was not the same thing as approaching the truth.

In the midst of life, everything revolved around death.



## Chapter 3

We walked - and walked, and walked.

She would lead, and I would follow close behind.

When I saw her room, I realized that, life me, she had wanted to go away to college and begin a new life far from anyone she knew.

My stories of Storm Trooper always made Naoko laugh. 
So I talked about him more often. 

My arm was not the one she needed, but the arm of someone else. My warmth was not what she needed, but the warmth of someone else. I felt almost guilty being me.

Sometimes Naoko would lock her eyes on to mine for no apparent reason. She seemed to be searching for something, and this would give me a strange, lonely, helpless sort of feeling.


I wanted to hold her tight when she did these things, but I would hesitate and hold back. I was afraid I might hurt her.

There was no way to explain the truth to them, and no need to explain it so I let them think what they wanted to. I had to face a barrage of stupid questions in the evening - what position had we used? What was she like down there? What color underwear had she been wearing that day? I gave them the answers they wanted.

I seemed to have caught her word-searching sickness.

I would stare at the grains of life suspended in that silent space, struggling to see into my own heart. What did I want? And what did others want from me? But I could never find the answers. Sometimes I would reach out and try to grasp the grains of light, but my fingers touched nothing.

With my eyes closed, I would touch a familiar book and draw it's fragrance deep inside me. This was enough to make me happy.


I would pull it off the shelf when the mood hit me and read a section at random. It never once disappointed me.


She continued to cry without a sound. Her fingers began to move across my back as is in search of something, some important thing that had always been there.


Something inside me had dropped away, and nothing came in to fill the empty cavern.

As long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the emptiness inside.


Waiting for your answer is one of the most painful things I have ever been through. At least let me know whether or not I hurt you.


[Letter from Naoko]
Please forgive me for not answering sooner. But try to understand. It took me a very long time before I was in any condition to write, and I have started this letter at least ten times. Writing is a painful process for me.
What I need now is to rest my nerves in a quiet place cut off from the world.
I am not prepared to see you. It’s not that I don’t want to see you: I’m simply not prepared for it.


I read Naoko’s letter again and again, and each time I would be filled with that same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko herself stared into my eyes.

There was no hope of a phone call, but I didn’t know what else to do with the time. I would switch on a baseball game and pretend to watch it as I cut the empty space between me and the televisions set in two, then cut each half in two again, over and over, until I had fashioned a space small enough to hold in my hand.

I hadn’t seen a firefly in years, but the ones in my memory sent a far more intense light into the summer darkness, and that brilliant, burning image was the one that had stayed with me all that time.


I waited for ever. Only much later did the firefly take to the air. As is some though had suddenly occurred to it, the firefly spread it's wings, and in a moment it had flown past the handrail to float in the pale darkness. It traced a swift arc by the side of the water tank as though trying to bring back a lost interval in time. And then, after hovering there for a few seconds as is to watch it curved line of light blend into the wind, it finally flew off to the east. Long after the firefly had disappeared, the trail of it's light remained inside me, it's pale, faint glow hovering on and on in the thick darkness behind my eyelids like a lost soul. More than once I tried stretching my hand out in the dark. My fingers touched nothing. The faint glow remained, just beyond my grasp.




## Chapter 4

The wind changes direction a little, and their cries become whispers.

[Storm Trooper]
This was a man whose greatest joy in life was to control everything and keep others in the dark.

Nobody likes being alone that much. I don’t go out of my way to make friends, that’s all. It just leads to disappointment.

Life doesn’t require ideals. It requires standards of action.

A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do but what he should do.

I wrote about my summer travels - the roads I had walked, the towns I had passed through, the people I had met. And every night I though of you. Now that I can no longer see you, I realize how much I need you.
Everything seems pointless since you left. I’d like to have a nice, long talk with you. If possible, I’d like to visit your sanatorium and see you for several hours. And, if possible, I’d like to go out walking with you side by side the way we used to. Please try to answer this letter - even a short note. I won’t mind.

She took me to her old school, a short walk from Yotsuya.
Passing the station, I though about Naoko and our endless walking. It had all started from there. I realized that if I hadn’t run into Naoko on the train that Sunday in May, my life would have been very different from what it was now. But when I changed my mind: no, even if we hadn’t met that day, my life might not have been any different. We were supposed to meet. If not then, some other time. I didn’t have any basis for thinking this: it was just a feeling.

“You’re very clear about what you like and what don’t like”, she said.
“Maybe so”, I said. “Maybe that’s why people don’t like me. Never have.”
“It's because you show it”, she said. “You make it obvious you don’t care whether people like you or not. That makes people angry.”




## Chapter 5


I believe that I’ve not been fair to you and that, as a result, I must have led you around in circles and hurt you deeply. In doing so, however, I have led myself around in circles and hurt myself just as deeply.
If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me.



How wonderful it is to be able to write someone a letter! To feel like conveying your thoughts to a person, to sit at your desk and pick up a pen, to put your thoughts into words like this is truly marvellous. Of course, once I do put them into words, I find I can only express a fraction of what I want to say, but that’s all right. I’m happy just to be able to feel I want to write to someone.

The one thing I don’t want to be is a burden to anyone. I can sense the good feelings you have for me. They make me very happy. All I am doing in this letter is trying to convey that happiness to you. Those good feelings of yours are probably just what I need at this point in my life.

“Ami” means friend. It is a French word.




## Chapter 6
[Toru meets Naoko and her friend Reiko]

[Going to meet Naoko]


The occasional flapping of wings echoes in the woods. The sound came through with strange clarity, as is amplified above the other voices of the forest.

What an incredible quiet place! There were no sounds of any kind. It was as though everyone were taking a siesta. People, animals, insects, plants must all be sound asleep, I thought, it was such a quiet afternoon.

The best thing about this place is the way everybody helps everybody else. Everybody knows they’re flawed in some way, and so they try to help each other.

We’re all each other’s mirrors, and the doctors are part of us.

What happens when people open their hearts? “They get better”, she said.

Filled with a sense of of Naoko’s presence. In the kitchen were the dishes Naoko used, in the bathroom was the toothbrush Naoko used, and in the bedroom was the bed in which Naoko slept. Sleeping soundly in this flat of hers, I wrung the fatigue from every cell of my body, drop by drop. I dreamed of a butterfly dancing in the half light.


The paint I felt was excruciating. It was as is my life had ended. Here I was in my early twenties and the best part of my life was over. Do you see how terrible that would be? I had such a potential, then woke up one day and it had gone. No more applause, no one would make a big fuss over me, no one would tell me how wonderful I was.

We went everywhere, around walked about everything, and I got to like him a lot. When I was with him, I felt as is my life had finally come back to me. It gave me a wonderful sense of relief to be alone with him.

Life was still full of wonderful things I hadn’t experienced. Is only for having made me feel that way, I felt tremendously grateful to him.

As long as I was with him, my troubles would stay away. That’s the most important thing for a sickness like ours: a sense of trust. Is I put myself in this person’s hands, I’ll be OK. If my condition starts to worsen even the slightest bit - is a screw comes loose - he’ll notice straight away, and with tremendous care and patience he’ll fix it, he’ll tighten the screw again, put all the jumbled threads back in place. Is we have the sense of trust, our sickness stays away.

To be able to perform music for yourself is a wonderful thing.

I loved his weak side, too, I loved it as much as I loved his good side. There was absolutely nothing mean or underhand about him.
I couldn’t tell the difference between his strong points and his flaws, there were all the same to me.

Our faces were no more than ten inches apart, but she was light years away from me. 

“Morning is the favourite time of the day”, said Naoko. “It’s like everything’s starting out fresh and new. I begin to get sad around noon time, and I hate it when the sun goes down. I live with those same feelings day after day.”

I want you to come to see me every once in awhile, and always remember me. That’s all I want.


Everything ended when you asked me to wait a month. Is you really wanted to start again, you shouldn't have said that to me.

I’ll ask you for the same thing, and make you suffer. I don’t want to do that any more.
[Why do some people leave the ones they love because they love them so much?]

I didn’t want to force anyone to live in constant fear that I might lose my mind at any moment.
[Regardless of how painful would the separation be for her husband]

“He had been wonderful to me: an ideal husband, faithful, strong and patient, someone I could put my complete trust in. He had done everything he could to heal me, and I had done everything I could to be healed, both for his sake and for our daughter’s.

“That’s why I can’t leave this place”, she said. “I’m afraid to get involved with the outside world. I’m afraid to meet new people and feel new feelings”.[Actually true]

“It feels as if we’re the only ones in the world. I wish it would just keep raining so the three of us could stay together.” 

“Will you come to see me again?” she asked.
“And will you write?”

Naoko asked, “Will you really come to see me again?”

Naoko touched her lips to my forehead and slipped out of bed.
[Me]:[Kissing the forehead is probably the loveliest gesture to me.



## Chapter 7


I probably still haven’t completely adapted to the world.
I don’t know, I feel like this isn’t the real world. The people, the scene: they just don’t seem real to me.

People are strange when you are a stranger.

[About Midori]
People are always trying to force stuff on me. The minute they see me they start telling me what to do. At least you don’t try to force stuff on me.

It's the working class that keeps the world running, and it's the working class that get exploited.

It's basically impossible for everybody’s justice to prevail or everybody’s happiness to triumph, so chaos takes over. ANd then what do you think happens? Simply - a god appears at the end and starts directing the traffic. ‘You go there, and you come here, and you get together with her, and you just sit still for a while.’ He’s a kind of fixer, and in the end everything works out perfectly. They call this ‘deus ex machina’.
[ deus ex mahina - meaning - an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel.]

What is there were a deus ex machina in real life?

“I don’t know, I think he just saw me enjoying my own cucumber”.

It's hard not being able to see you, but my life in Tokyo would be a lot worse if it weren’t for you. It's because I think of you and when I’m in bed in the morning that I can wind my spring and tell myself I have to live another good day. I know I have to give it my best here just as you are doing there.

The Sunday crowds gave me some relief.

How many Sundays - how many hundreds of Sundays like this - lay ahead of me? “Quiet, peaceful, and lonely,” I said aloud to myself. On Sundays, I didn’t wind my spring.



## Chapter 8


Languages are like games. You learn the rules for one, and they all work the same way.

That’s not hard work. It's just manual labour. The ‘hard work’ I’m talking about is more self-directed and purposeful.

I have a need of human warmth.
[Me]:[Need not always be physical, in fact most of the times emotional/mental]

I’m not that strong. I don’t feel it's OK is OK nobody understands me. I’ve got people I want to understand and be understood by. But aside from those few, well, I feel it's kind of hopeless. I do care is people understand me.

It must be a wonderful thing to be so sure that you love somebody.

I think of you now more than ever.



## Chapter 9


Who would ever think they wanted to be with somebody they didn't like?

[Naoko]
I have tons of things I want to talk about, to tell you about. It's just hard for me to put them into words. Which is why it's so painful for me to write letters.



## Chapter 10

I trudged my eyes through each day in it's turn, rarely looking up, eyes locked on the nerve-ending swamp that lay before me, planting my right foot, raising my left, planting my left foot, raising my right, never sure where I was, never sure I was headed in the right direction, knowing only I had to keep moving, one step at a time.

[LOVE]
I could make myself feel far happier just thinking about Naoko than sleeping with some stupid, anonymous girl.

Instead of answering, Naoko turned her gaze to the outside.

The most important thing is for us to be always near each other.

But then I began to think how I would have felt is the tables had been turned and Midori had moved somewhere without telling me where or getting in touch with me for three weeks. I would have been hurt - hurt badly, no doubt. No, we weren’t lovers, but in a way we had opened ourselves to each other even more deeply than lovers do. The thought caused me a good deal of grief. What a terrible thing it is to wound someone you really care for - and do it so unconsciously.

[Me]:[There are times in life, when adversity is what one forces in everything, even where it is least expected]

And once a week I would write to Naoko. I never suggested to her that I was hoping for an answer. I didn’t want to pressure her any way.

I know you must have had a difficult month waiting for an answer, but believe me, the month has been just as difficult.

[Reiko on behalf of Naoko]
I can tell you exactly what her reason was: “I want my body to be clean of all this when I need him”

The best thing you can do meanwhile is hope for her recovery and keep sending her those letters.
[The letters mattered so so much. He or she neither actually needed to open and read. Empty letters would have worked, just the fact that they recalled each other, felt it was important to send one to make the other feel the human warmth!]

To tell the truth, thinking was the last thing I wanted to do. The time would come soon enough when I had no choice in the matter, and when that time came I would take a good, long while to think things over. Not now, though. Not now.

I will never, ever, turn my back on her. First of all, because I love her, and because I’m stronger than she is. And I’m just going to keep on getting stronger. I’m going to mature. I’m going to be an adult. Because that’s what I have to do. I always used to think I’d like to stay 17 or 18 if I could. But not any more, I’m not a teenager any more. I’ve got a sense of responsibility now. I’m not the same person I was when we used to hang out together. I’m 20 now. And I have to pay the price to go on living.

[Life is like a box of chocolates]
You know, they’ve got these chocolate assortments, and you like some but you don’t like others? And you eat all the ones you like, and the only ones left are the ones you don’t like as much? I always think about that when something painful comes up.

[To Naoko]
I’ve decided to make myself strong. As far as I can tell, that’s all I can do.
There’s one other thing. Maybe it's just to do with me, and you may not care about this one way or another, but I’m not sleeping with anybody any more. It's because I don't want to forget the last time you touched me. It meant a lot more to me than you might think. I think about it all of the time.

All of them had gone away from where I stood. Now I had no one to say “Good morning” to or “Have a nice day”. I spent the whole month with this hopeless sense of isolation.

In the deepening spring of May, I had no choice but to recognize the trembling of my heart. It usually happened as the sun was going down. In the pale evening gloom, when the soft fragrance of magnolias hung in the air, my heart would swell without warning, and tremble, and lurch with a stab of pain. I would try clamping my eyes shut and gritting my teeth, and wait for it to pass. And it would pass - but slowly, taking it's own time, and leaving a dull ache in it's path.

In my letters to her, I would describe only things that were touching or pleasant or beautiful: the fragrance of grasses, the caress of a spring breeze, the light of the moon, a film I’d seen, a song I liked, a book that had moved me. I myself would be comforted by letters like this when I would reread what I had written.

She’s fine most of the time, but sometimes her emotions become extremely unstable, and when that  happens we can’t take our eyes off. There’s no telling what she would do. When she has those intense episodes of hearing voices, she shuts down completely and burrows inside herself.

[From Reiko]
And even though Naoko is not here anymore, please write to me once in awhile.

It was as if I were writing letters to hold together the pieces of my crumbling life.

But one thing became crystal clear to me when I couldn’t see you any more. I realized that the only way I had been able to survive until then was having you in my life. When I lost you, the pain and loneliness really got me.

So don’t brood over everything in that super-serious way of yours. All of us(by which I mean all of us, both normal and not-so-normal) are imperfect human beings living in an imperfect world. We don’t live with the mechanical precision of a bank account or by measuring all our lines and angles with rulers and protractors.

It's like taking a boat out on a beautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the lake are beautiful. So stop eating yourself up. Things will go where they’re supposed to go is you just let them take their natural course. Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for them to be hurt.

You try too hard to make life fit your way of doing things. If you don’t want to spend time in an insane asylum, you have to open up a little more and let yourself go with life’s natural flow.

Work at making yourself happy.
[Being overly careful in one situation, may lead you to make disastrous decisions/choices in situation where not meant]

Grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people.



## Chapter 11

Death in that place was not a decisive element that brought life to an end. There, death  was but one of many elements comprising life. There Naoko lived with death inside her. And to me she said, “Don’t worry, it's only death. Don't let it bother you”
[Death is not the opposite of life, it is a part of it]

Eventually, though, the tide would pull back, and I would be left on the beach alone. Powerless, I could go nowhere; sadness itself would envelop me in deep darkness until the tears came.

Death exists, not as the opposite but as part of life.
By living our lives, we nurture death.

No truth can cure sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning it to no one but myself.g.

Sometimes I feel like the caretaker of a museum - a huge, empty museum where no one ever comes, and I’m watching .

“Letters are just pieces of paper,” I said. “Burn them, and what stays in your heart will stay; keep them, and what vanishes will vanish.”
