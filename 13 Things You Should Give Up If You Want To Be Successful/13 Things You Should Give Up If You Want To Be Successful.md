> Sometimes, to become successfully, we do not need to add more things, we need to give up on some of them.

## Give up unhealthy lifestyle
* Healthy diet
* Physical activity


## Give up on the short-term mindse
* Successful people set long-term goals, and they know that these aims are merely the result of short-term habits that they need to do every day.
* These healthy habits should not be something you do; they should be something you are.
* There is a difference between: “Working out to have summer body” and “Working out because that is who you are.”


## Give up playing small
> “Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone, and as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our fear, our presence automatically liberates others”. - Marianne Williamson
* Voice your ideas (well framed), don't be afraid to fail, and certainly don't be afraid to succeed.


## Give up your excuses
* You are responsible for your life, no matter what your starting point was, your weaknesses and past failures.
* You are responsible for what happens next in your life, both frightening and exciting.
* Excuses limit and prevent us from growing personally and professionally.
* Own your life; no one else will


## Give up the fixed mindset
* Future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.
* In a fixed mindset, people believe that their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits and that talent alone creates success - without effort. They are wrong.
* Successful people invest an immense amount of time on a daily basis.
* Who you are today, is not who you have to be tomorrow.


## Give up believing in the “Magic Bullet”


## Give up your perfectionism
* Nothing will ever be perfect, no matter how much we try.
* Fear of failure (or even fear of success) often prevents us from taking action and putting our creation out there in the world.
* Many opportunities are lost while we wait for things to be right.
* “Shipping beats perfection” - Khan Academy’s Development Mantra


## Give up multi tasking
> “You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks.” - Winston Churchill
* Successful people choose one thing at a time and then beat it into submission.
* Being fully present and committed to one task, is indispensable


## Give up on your need to control everything
* Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.
* Differentiating these two is important and crucial.
* Detach from the things you cannot control, and focus on the ones you can, and know that sometimes, the only thing you will be able to monitor is your attitude towards something.


## Give up saying YES to things that don't support your goals


## Give up the toxic people
* You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.


## Give up on your need to be liked
> “The only way to avoid pissing people off is to do nothing important.” - Oliver Emberton
* No matter what you do, you will never be able to make the whole market like you.
* The only thing you can do is continue being authentic, and know that growing number of “haters” means that you are doing important things.


## Give up on your dependency on the social media & television
> “The trouble is you think you have time” - Buddha
* Impulsive web browsing and television watching is a disease of today’s society.
* These 2 should never be an escape from your life or your goals.
